This directory contains source file for the SPU parser. This parser
takes incoming commands for each orb robot and parses them into
various actions.


After examining parser generators like lex/YACC, flex/Bison, and
re2c, we are going with the "lemon" parser generator because it is
small, fast, reentrant, and can be easily configured as a "push"
parser (that is, we send it the data to be parsed rather than having
it read it from a stream).  The lemon parser is available here: 
http://www.hwaci.com/sw/lemon/


Files in this dir are adapted from the tutorial examples from here:
http://freshmeat.net/articles/view/1270/



Files:

lemon.c : the parser generator source. Compile with gcc -o lemon lemon.c in any architecture. 

scan.y: a scanner specification (Lemon input)

scanfrontend.c: contains the main() and code to test the parser generated by scan.y. It is 
concatenated with scan.c (Lemon output) and compiled to give a test program that reads from stdin. 
See the Makefile.
