This directory contains code/scripts/config files/images,etc. 
used by/on the SPU OS image, rather than application code. 

You can either apply the patches in here to your existing system
or just take the files and drop them in on top of the existing
ones you have installed on your SPU. 
It is recommended that you at least look at the patches so you
can tell what's been added/deleted/moved around, etc. 

HTH,
Let me know if you have any questions about anything...
