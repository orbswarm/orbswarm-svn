
SWARM business cards HOWTO


We've had good success with psprint.com. They do great work provided you follow their prepress instructions

I made a template that has most of the tricky stuff done already (CMYK
mode, special black, extra space for grippers, etc). It's in Adobe
Illustrator format because it has layers and because that's a
preferred upload format for psprint. (If you don't have Illustrator,
let me know and I can customize a file for you -- jon)

The generic (unpersonalized) business card is SWARM_buisinesscard.ai.
It has info@orbswarm under the SWARM title.

The personalized version has the SWARM website instead of the email,
and templates for your name and contact info.

To order your own, first customize the personal card
template SWARM_personalcard.ai, then upload as follows:

1. Customize or delete the personal text. (Though it's fun to make up
   job titles, let's not.)  If you want to add more info (phone, etc.)
   go ahead but preserve as much white space as possible. Don't change
   fonts or you risk upsetting the font snobs.

2. Delete all layes with an "(X)" in front. Yes, even the die template. 

3. "flatten layers" and save as a different filename

4. Start the order process at
http://www.psprint.com/printing_products/die_cut_business_card_printing.asp
   Upload the flattened file you just made

5. Strangely enough, there's no way to select the die in the order 
   process. Do it in the production notes. Towards the end of the order
   there's a box that says "Need to change part of your order? Simply
   post a note here"

   This is what I put there and it seemed to work:

   "Please use die entitled "3.5x2 Business Card Circle Edge" on p. 12
   of your die gallery

   THANK YOU!
