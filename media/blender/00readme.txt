Blender is an open-source 3d modeling/rendering program, which is free and pretty powerful, and runs 
on all OSs. Get it here: http://www.blender.org/ The learning curve is pretty gnarly, so I can't recommend 
it totally without reservation.) 

Blender lets you add light sources and render things (which may be possible in SW but I don't think so). 
So I did a little experiment with internal lights (litshell.blend). It's wrong in several ways (no internal chassis) but it's enough to get the idea. 

The shell is on layer 2, you can turn it off to get to the lights inside. I added some plates to block the lights like the chassis and the bearings would.
