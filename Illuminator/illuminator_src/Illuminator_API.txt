The Iluuminator board listens to the serial port for commands of the form

"<"-"L"-optionalAddress-commandChar-optIntData-">"

All commands are prefixed with <L and suffixed with > to indicate end of data

optionalAddress is a 1-char integer between 0 and 9. If this is
specified, only boards with that address will respond. If not
specified, all boards will respond.

optIntData is unsigned short or unsigned char integer data in one or
more ascii characters. Not every command has data.

CommandChar is one of the following:

 (These "immediate" commands don't take an integer argument, but they
 do something)

'F' -- execute fade program from current color to target color
    Example <LF> -- execute fade on all boards

'P' -- execute pulse program with current color and target color pulses
    Example <L2P> -- execute pulse only on board 2

'Z' -- execute sawtooth program. Vary between current color and target color.
    Example <L0Z> -- execute sawtooth on board 0

The remaining commands take an integer argument N (but nothing will
happen until one of the immediate commands (F,P,Z) is called.)

'H' -- set target hue to N. 
    Example: <LH64> -- set target hue to 64 on all boards

'V' -- set target value to N. 
    Example: <LV0> -- set target val to 0 on all boards

'S' -- set target saturation  to N. 
    Example: <LS255> -- set target to 255 on all boards

'T' -- set time to N milliseconds
    Example: <LT1000> -- set program time to 1 second on all boards

'A' -- set board address to N
    Example: <L1A5> Changes any boards at address 1 to address 5. 
    (Using this command without an address is a bad idea with multiple boards.)
    

Commands are cumulative: to turn all illuminators off immediately,
send a value of zero to all, then execute a fade with a zero time
value, in other words send the string "<LV0><LT0><LF>"
