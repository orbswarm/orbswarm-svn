This directory conatins input and output and configuration files for
GerbMerge, a Python utility to "panelize" (step-and-repeat copy) a
printed circuit board.  GerbMerge.bat copies the source files from the
directory above and invokes GerbMerge (you need to install python) to
produce an output PCB containing several copies of the input.  More
information on gerbmerge is here
http://claymore.engineer.gvsu.edu/~steriana/Python/gerbmerge/

or google gerbmerge

You will want to check that things look OK. Use a gerber file viewer
like ViewMate (free reg req)

or GerbView (free, open source, a little buggy)
