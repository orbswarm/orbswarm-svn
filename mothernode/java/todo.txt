   - complete the communcations class OrbIo
   - complete the live motion model class LiveModel
   - provide ways to display message
   - complete Button class
   - provide ways to specify route
   - improve control interface
   - develope orb state display
   - develope interface to control orb:
      - behavior/choreography/emergency-stop
      - lighting
      - audio

done:

   - check code into subversion (12 June 2007)
   - create todo list :) (12 June 2007)


Simran's list
   - MP3 sound files. 
   - ColorScheme specialist, with special schemer hookup
   - RandomSong specialist, with BV hookup
   - property events
   - read colors from properties (generalize color from string)
   - X take motion out of SwarmCon simulator. 
   - fix color wheel not responding to mouse. 
   - get song files, timelines, etc from resources rather than from 
     filesystem. (i.e. run from jar when not in mothernode/java)
   - OrbControlImpl: toggle to turn on/off:
      . production protocols for sound/light/motion
      . simulation for sound
      . simulation for colors

done:
   - composite events (070815)
   - durations as alternate to specify endTimes (070815)
   - color events get color patch display.  (070815)
   - read available timelines from resources/timelines directory   (070815)
   - implement color fade time.    (070815)
   - simulate orb fade times.    (070815)
   - MultiTrack song specialist (tracks in properties)    (070816)
   - figure out refresh flashing stuff.   (070816)
   - sound file -> hashkey compiler & sound file mover   (070816)
   - if end time not specified, calculate duration from (070817)
     (song time, fade time, etc)
      . this would mean creating all the specialists up front
