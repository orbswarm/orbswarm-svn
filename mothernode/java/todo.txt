   - complete the communcations class OrbIo
   - complete the live motion model class LiveModel
   - provide ways to display message
   - complete Button class
   - provide ways to specify route
   - improve control interface
   - develope orb state display
   - develope interface to control orb:
      - behavior/choreography/emergency-stop
      - lighting
      - audio

done:

   - check code into subversion (12 June 2007)
   - create todo list :) (12 June 2007)


Simran's list
   - MP3 sound files. 
   - read colors from properties (generalize color from string)
   - read orbs as orbs: -> EOL instead of (in addition to) <orbs> ... </orbs>
   - robustify token reader to tokenize <token> or </token> without needing
     spaces around it. 
   - get song files, timelines, properties, etc from resources rather than from 
     filesystem. (i.e. run from jar when not in mothernode/java)
   - motion events
   - property events display on the event line they affect
   - robustify timeline display: take label & font size into account when placing events
     in different tracks. 
       . more compact label for triggers
       . more compact label for props
   - place more constants in properties file
   - get volume slider right
   - zooming and panning on timeline display. 
   - master sound files equally (normalize->90%?)

done:
   - composite events                                              (070815)
   - durations as alternate to specify endTimes                    (070815)
   - color events get color patch display.                         (070815)
   - read available timelines from resources/timelines directory   (070815)
   - implement color fade time.                                    (070815)
   - simulate orb fade times.                                      (070815)
   - MultiTrack song specialist (tracks in properties)             (070816)
   - figure out refresh flashing stuff.                            (070816)
   - sound file -> hashkey compiler & sound file mover             (070816)
   - if end time not specified, calculate duration from            (070817)
     (song time, fade time, etc)
      . this would mean creating all the specialists up front
   - property events                                               (preplaya)
   - ColorScheme specialist, with special schemer hookup           (preplaya)

   - RandomSong specialist, with BV hookup                         (preplaya)
   - OrbControlImpl: toggle to turn on/off:                        (onplaya)
      . production protocols for sound/light/motion
      . simulation for sound
      . simulation for colors
   - framework to read constants from properties file              (070909)
   - fix color wheel not responding to mouse.                      (070909)
