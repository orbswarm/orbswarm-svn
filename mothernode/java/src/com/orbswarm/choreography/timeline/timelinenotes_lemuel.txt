i don't know if you two have met, but simran - lemuel, lemual -  
simran.  simran has written a bunch of sound and lighting related  
code and integrated it into my stuff.  you two should probably talk. :)

 Has this part already been written in which case I can just look at
 the existing design?

 Thanks.

 Hey Trebor,

 Ok so I've come up with some requirements of sorts for designing and
 storing movements for the orbs.

 I started backwards from what would be needed by the system to run
 the orbs.  The data structure could be quite different but I think
 this captures all the data that could be captured at design time and
 then processed by the mothership.  Let me know what you think, and
 what should be added.  Also let me know the different movement types
 you can think of off the top of your head that you've implemented or
 that wouldn't be alogithmically too complex to add considering the
 controls.

 <time>  (time in seconds or ms from the beginning of the first  
 movement)
   <name> (optional)
   <notes> (optional -- for performers, for intent, etc.)
    <orb> (just here to show data structure idea- for each time we have
 multiple orbs)
     <orbnumber>  (between 1 and 6)
     <sound>  (file name?  - optional to allow for music to stay on  
 what was)
     <color>  (optional to allow for what was before)
       <r>
       <g>
       <b>
     <movement>
       <movementtype> (go to position x, follow this or that, ...)  
 => could
 be stored algorithm, or closer to exact controls
       <accompanying data> (point, speed to achieve,  
 direction, ....)  =>
 how can we structure this for multiple possibilities

 So the idea is that a choreography is a succession of time slices  
 where the
 behavior of at least one orb changes.  At time X if an orb changes  
 color,
 sound it's playing or movement, that's in there.  Maybe we can have no
 change too, to allow for some notes to describe what is about to  
 happen or
 some such thing.  I think the color thing hasn't been fleshed out  
 as there
 might be more than one changeable light per orb.  In which case  
 those have
 to be specified.  Movement is where we need to make lists of movements
 available from a low level, up to algorithms that have already been  
 created.
 Not sure the best way to add accompanying data.  For example if  
 it's follow
 the leader, then you specify the orb number you're following, if  
 you specify
 get to this point while being headed in this direction at this  
 speed, then
 you specify more.

 So for using the application that would help design this I imagine  
 a line at
 the bottom that corresponds to the time of the piece (at first  
 nothing, then
 from first movement at 0 to time of last specification.  On this  
 line every
 time point that's added appears, and can be clicked to edit, or a  
 new one
 can be created (with a button click?).  For each time spot the  
 designer can
 specify all items above for each orb.  Maybe if we have a list of  
 predefined
 movements we can add those to a drop down list.  For location we  
 can click
 the new location on the screen, which shows where each orb would  
 most likely
 be at that time.  For color, maybe a color wheel popup, or just the  
 values
 for R, G and B.

 While we play back, each time element can appear as it's playing back.
 Someone was asking if the map could appear on one screen while the  
 data on
 another.

 We can talk on the phone or meet in person to discuss this  
 further.  These
 are some starting ideas.  Let me know what you think, if this is too
 ambitious, etc.

 Cheers,
 Lemuel
