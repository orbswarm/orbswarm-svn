There are two mother nodes programs.  The python monther provides
joystick control of orbs and a control panel to display orb status, it
has been tested and shown to work.  The java mother node is intended to
provide a more complete set of services including:

   - orb simulation       
   - a laboratory for development of a library of orb behaviors
   - a tool for choreographing performances
   - a real time swarm control interface

The code for the respective mother nodes can be found in the "python"
and "java" directories as one would expect.
